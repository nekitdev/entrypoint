> *Decorated functions as entry points.*

In python, an *entry point* can be thought of as an explicit function
that gets called when the script is run directly from the console.

Defining an entry point requires some boilerplate code, which is
abstracted away by this library.

## Installing

**Python 3.7 or above is required.**

### pip

Installing the library with `pip` is quite simple:

```console
$ pip install entrypoint
```

Alternatively, the library can be installed from source:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/nekitdev/entrypoint.git
$ cd entrypoint
$ python -m pip install .
```

### poetry

You can add `entrypoint` as a dependency with the following command:

```console
$ poetry add entrypoint
```

Or by directly specifying it in the configuration like so:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
entrypoint = "^1.4.0"
```

Alternatively, you can add it directly from the source:

```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies.entrypoint]
git = "https://github.com/nekitdev/entrypoint.git"
```

## Examples

### Decorated

Declare the `main` function as an *entry point*:

```python
from entrypoint import entrypoint

@entrypoint(__name__)
def main() -> None:
    print("Hello, world!")
```

Run the script directly from the console:

```console
$ python file.py
Hello, world!
```

When importing the module, `main` does not get called:

```python
>>> import file
>>> # no output
```

### Note

Note that `main` gets called **immediately, before any code below can be executed**.

```python
@entrypoint(__name__)
def main() -> None:
    print("-> in main")

print("<- outside")
```

```console
$ python note.py
-> in main
<- outside
```

### Direct

It is possible to run `main` directly:

```python
entrypoint(__name__).call(main)
```

This method allows to take control over where and when the function gets called.

### Check

`entrypoint` also provides `is_main` function that resembles
the common (and de-facto standard) way of implementing *entry points*:

```python
from entrypoint import is_main

if is_main(__name__):
    print("Hello, world!")
```

### Return

`entrypoint` expects `main` functions to not return anything. Even though this is *not* checked
at *runtime*, returning from `main` will cause *type-checkers* to *error*!

### Async

`entrypoint` does not provide any specific functionality to run async functions.

Instead, you can specify, for example, a `main` function that runs its `async_main` counterpart:

```python
from async_extensions import run

async def async_main() -> None:
    print("Hello, world!")

@entrypoint(__name__)
def main() -> None:
    run(async_main())
```
